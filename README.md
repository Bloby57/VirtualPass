**Welcome to VirtualPass, a simple yet effective Virtual Hall Pass manager**<br>
***
## What is VirtualPass?
VirtualPass is a simple website for checking in or out students from a classroom with a scan and go system based off of QR codes.<br><br>
VirtualPass is very easy to set up and requires no third party dependencies, it supplies easy to visualize graphs and system configuration right from the web page.<br><br>
User data is stored outside the readable web scope so only the API with an API key can access this data.<br><br>
